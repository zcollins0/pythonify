pythonify
=========

Build a wall (of semicolons and brackets) and make your coworkers pay for it!

###Usage:
- get a c, c++, or java file you want pythonified
- perl pythonify.pl inputfile outputfile

###Notes:
- if your source file has lines longer than 100 characters, change the wallIndex to something higher
- if you have lots of brackets on the same line it might not work perfectly
